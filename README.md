# LaravelCurrencyComparator-App

Personal Project

## Description

I have developed a web application in Laravel which generates on-demand relevant charts comparing 
the evolution of physical/cryptocurrencies exchange rates. The raw financial data is provided by 
two publicly available APIs (European Central Bank and Alpha Vantage) and it is preprocessed in 
the back-end layer of the application to integrate with the third-party charts package. 
The front-end makes use of Bootstrap and the application is hosted on Heroku.
